# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C.

## About

A collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented for learning and reference purposes.

## Contents

This repository includes implementations of:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Graph traversal, and other fundamental algorithms

## Usage

Each implementation is contained in its own directory with source code and documentation.

To compile and run:
```bash
gcc -o program main.c [other_files.c]
./program
```

## Structure

Each data structure or algorithm implementation includes:
- Source code files
- Header files
- Test cases
- Individual README with specific details

## Requirements

- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Standard C library

## Getting Started

Navigate to any directory to explore specific implementations. Each contains its own documentation and examples.

## License

Open source project available for educational use.
